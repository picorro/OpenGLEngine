# C++ OpenGL Game Engine
A simple OpenGL rendering system from https://learnopengl.com/
Initially I thought of writing my own from scratch, but I felt too overwhelmed, so I will edit the rendering system once I realize fully what I want to do.

Currently I am working on creating my first Components such as Transform, Camera (this will be a challenge likely), some physics components.

Since I can always expand the list of Components it does not really matter where I start.

Ultimately I would hope this to be something even remotely close to a game engine.
